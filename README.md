## Implementation of *Crafting Interpreters* in Both C and Rust  
The reference book is [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com).   
Project structure of the C implementation is almost the same with the original implementation in book, with few modifications in detail.    
The Rust implementation may be not as mature and efficient as expected, since I am not very familiar with the design pattern or some skills or tricks in Rust.   
If you happen to take a view of my implementation, I shall be glad and appreciative of your generous advice. (^-^)
